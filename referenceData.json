		"description":"To test an automation there's three stages you can follow. Testing the action, the condition and action, and the whole automation:\n\n1) Use _Configuration_ -> _Automations_ to find the automation and then push _Run Actions_. If this fails your problem is in the `action:` section, and details should be found in your log file\n2) Use _Developer tools_ -> _Services_ and call `automation.trigger` on the automation with `skip_condition: false`. If the first passes but this fails then the problem is in your `condition:` block\n3) Use _Developer tools_ -> _States_ to find the trigger entity, click the name, then change the state (at the top) to something that'll trigger the automation before pushing _Set State_. If this fails then the problem is with your `trigger:` section, or the automation is turned off (you can check that in _Developer tools -> States_).\n\nYou can also see [this section in the docs](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/troubleshooting/) and with HA 2021.4 onwards [debug automations](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2021/04/07/release-20214/#automation-debugging).",

It is super cheap, and when everyone realized that it was much more capable than being just a wifi bridge, people started using it in projects and products.  Espressif heard about what was being done with their chips and started releasing different modules with all of the pins exposed.\n\nThere aren't very many pins, though, and some of them are a bit... quirky to use.  But, because they're cheap, many smart home gadget companies started using them as the main chip in their products.

As you get into a few dozen devices and hundreds of sensor data points, SQLite causes the occasional database corruption. If your Database file is over 1GB, if you are getting Recorder failures in the log, if sensor data randomly stops displaying in your user interface, it is probably time to purge the database. If this continues to happen to you, it may be time to replace the database with something else.\n\n  The easiest way to replace the database is to use the Official Add-on MariaDB.  This is a mysql based program that can handle larger amounts of data better than the default.  \n\nIf you are not running the supervised version of HA, there is a video for you in the links as well.  Also other database solutions will work with Home Assistant, see the link for the recorder integration for more details.",

It was developed by IBM in 1999, and was initially used to monitor oil pipeline sensors and communicate with satellites. It became very popular, and is used extensively in SCADA control systems and smarthome products.\n\nMQTT utilizes a central service called a Broker that can be installed on just about any computer or server.  Clients connect to the Broker to monitor and update various Topics.  Subscriber Clients connect to the Broker and monitor a Topic; Publisher Clients connect to the Broker and update a Topic's value.  A Client can fill either role or both.\n\nHome Assistant and other home automation packages fill both roles, as do most Wifi connected smart plugs and devices.\n\nThere are libraries available in many programming languages (e.g. Arduino and Python) which can be used in custom sensor applications.\n\nWhen troubleshooting MQTT issues, it is useful to use a utility such as MQTT Explorer.",

It enables us to use electronics where there are no electrical outlets nearby and increases ease of management by having power supplies centrally located for devices in hard-to-reach locations.  \n\nPOE comes in three standard flavors:  \n\n1) POE (802.3af) Delivers 15W @ 48V \n2)POE+ (802.3at) Delivers 30W @ 48V\n3)POE++ or 4PPoE (802.3bt) Delivers 60W-100W @ 48V (Depending upon type of 802.3bt used)  \n\nBe certain to review the power requirements of any POE Device prior to purchase to ensure that you're getting everything you need.  \n\nPOE will work with CAT5e, CAT6, and CAT7. As for non-POE installations, care should be taken to not kink or bed the cable too sharply as it will create problems.  \n\nDevices do not need to have ethernet ports!  There are POE Converters that can go from 48V DC to 5V DC or 12V DC, and can be plugged into ESP Wifi chips, or Single Board Computers. ",

Low power RF transmitters are allowed to broadcast within these frequency ranges. These small transmitters are usually binary type sensors because only a small message is able to be transmitted during an event. Door/Window sensors, PIR sensors, push button transmitters, remote controls and the like are the typical devices using these frequencies. There needs to be a receiver nearby to pick up these signals and act on the message received.\n\nDevices such as the [Itead RFBridge](http://drzzs.com/RF_Bridge) and the [Bond Bridge](https://bit.ly/DrZzsBondBridge) act as reciever hubs to collect data from these sensors and feed the data back to a program such as Home Assistant for further action.  With some devices like the [Itead Sonoff Slampher](https://bit.ly/DrZzsSlampher), the device can ‚Äòpair‚Äô with a matching RF transmitter bought separately and act on the information provided. Devices are not tied to a common standard (like Zwave) which 1, keeps the price very low, but 2, causes incompatibility between manufacturers.",

You can use it to control just about everything that you want (plugs, switches, dimmers, bulbs, et cetera).\n\nThe reason you'd load this firmware onto your devices is to keep your smart item traffic local to your premise, and not sending it to the cloud servers.  (So that when the internet goes out, your stuff still works correctly).\n\nTasmota is 100% free and open source making it a great product for the home automation community.\n\nThe community submits configuration templates for devices to a site maintained by a user named Blakadder, so most things are pretty easy to configure.  If you run across a new product without a template, you will need to work out where things like LEDs, relays, and the like are by adjusting template settings manually -- but once you've got it, you can submit it to the repository!.\n\nBlakadder's team also maintains a 'naughty list' of devices that are not compatible.",

Zigbee is often preferred to Wifi-based technologies due to its low power consumption and long battery life.  The downside to using zigbee is you need to have a HUB to communicate with all of your devices.  In some ways this is advantageous as it requires fewer devices connect to your wifi network.\n\nOne zigbee hub that has a high approval is the conbee 2.  It is not the cheapest option, but it is fairly easy to configure.  Another great option is Zigbee2MQTT which will relay zigbee data thru your mqtt broker.  Whichever hub you select, be sure to verify that devices are supported by your hub before buying as most hubs do not support every device.\n\nIf nothing else, Zigbee is a very powerful protocol that opens the horizon to many types of sensors, switches, and other types of home automation devices.\n\nüõë**CAUTION**üõë Zigbee operates in the 2.4 GHz Spectrum, which is shared with Wifi, Bluetooth, Microwave Ovens, and other things.  If you have a lot of 2.4 GHz at your location, your Zigbee may be unreliable.",
