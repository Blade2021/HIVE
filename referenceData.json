It is super cheap, and when everyone realized that it was much more capable than being just a wifi bridge, people started using it in projects and products.  Espressif heard about what was being done with their chips and started releasing different modules with all of the pins exposed.\n\nThere aren't very many pins, though, and some of them are a bit... quirky to use.

I would wait 10 minutes after deleting (or renaming the file before you restart HA to give the file a chance to rebuild. \n\n📖 [Official HA Docs on Recorder](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/recorder/) \n📖 [MariaDB Supervised Addon](https://github.com/home-assistant/hassio-addons/tree/master/mariadb) \n📖 [WhatAreWeFixing.Today's YT Video](https://whatarewefixing.today/240/) \n📖 [Official HA Docs on Database](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/backend/database/) \n📖 [Reddit thread about non-default Databases](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/9z0tof/) \n📖 [BurnsHA's YT Video](https://youtu.be/4rsxnN8gkHk) \n\nThe default database that is used to store all recorded data in Home Assistant is SQLite.  As you get into a few dozen devices and hundreds of sensor data points, SQLite causes the occasional database corruption. If your Database file is over 1GB, if you are getting Recorder failures in the log, if sensor data randomly stops displaying in your user interface, it is probably time to purge the database. If this continues to happen to you, it may be time to replace the database with something else.\n\n  The easiest way to replace the database is to use the Official Add-on MariaDB.  This is a mysql based program that can handle larger amounts of data better than the default.  \n\nIf you are not running the supervised version of HA, there is a video for you in the links as well.  Also other database solutions will work with Home Assistant, see the link for the recorder integration for more details.",

It was developed by IBM in 1999, and was initially used to monitor oil pipeline sensors and communicate with satellites. It became very popular, and is used extensively in SCADA control systems and smarthome products.\n\nMQTT utilizes a central service called a Broker that can be installed on just about any computer or server.  Clients connect to the Broker to monitor and update various Topics.  Subscriber Clients connect to the Broker and monitor a Topic; Publisher Clients connect to the Broker and update a Topic's value.  A Client can fill either role or both.\n\nHome Assistant and other home automation packages fill both roles, as do most Wifi connected smart plugs and devices.\n\nThere are libraries available in many programming languages (e.g. Arduino and Python) which can be used in custom sensor applications.\n\nWhen troubleshooting MQTT issues, it is useful to use a utility such as MQTT Explorer.",

As for non-POE installations, care should be taken to not kink or bed the cable too sharply as it will create problems.  \n\nDevices do not need to have ethernet ports!

Low power RF transmitters are allowed to broadcast within these frequency ranges. These small transmitters are usually binary type sensors because only a small message is able to be transmitted during an event. Door/Window sensors, PIR sensors, push button transmitters, remote controls and the like are the typical devices using these frequencies. There needs to be a receiver nearby to pick up these signals and act on the message received.\n\nDevices such as the [Itead RFBridge](http://drzzs.com/RF_Bridge) and the [Bond Bridge](https://bit.ly/DrZzsBondBridge) act as reciever hubs to collect data from these sensors and feed the data back to a program such as Home Assistant for further action.  With some devices like the [Itead Sonoff Slampher](https://bit.ly/DrZzsSlampher), the device can ‘pair’ with a matching RF transmitter bought separately and act on the information provided. Devices are not tied to a common standard (like Zwave) which 1, keeps the price very low, but 2, causes incompatibility between manufacturers.",

It was originally used for Sonoff boards, but quickly snowballed to include *most* ESP MCU chips.  You can use it to control just about everything that you want (plugs, switches, dimmers, bulbs, et cetera).\n\nThe reason you'd load this firmware onto your devices is to keep your smart item traffic local to your premise, and not sending it to the cloud servers.  (So that when the internet goes out, your stuff still works correctly).\n\nTasmota is 100% free and open source making it a great product for the home automation community.\n\nThe community submits configuration templates for devices to a site maintained by a user named Blakadder, so most things are pretty easy to configure.  If you run across a new product without a template, you will need to work out where things like LEDs, relays, and the like are by adjusting template settings manually -- but once you've got it, you can submit it to the repository!.\n\nBlakadder's team also maintains a 'naughty list' of devices that are not compatible.",

		"description":"To test an automation there's three stages you can follow. Testing the action, the condition and action, and the whole automation:\n\n1) Use _Configuration_ -> _Automations_ to find the automationand then push _Run Actions_. If this fails your problem is in the `action:` section, and details should be found in your log file\n2) Use _Developer tools_ -> _Services_ and call `automation.trigger` on the automation with `skip_condition: false`. If the first passes but this fails then the problem is in your `condition:` block\n3) Use _Developer tools_ -> _States_ to find the trigger entity, click the name, then change the state (at the top) to something that'll trigger the automation before pushing _Set State_. If this fails then the problem is with your `trigger:` section, or the automation is turned off (you can check that in _Developer tools -> States_).\n\nYou can also see [this section in the docs](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/troubleshooting/) and with HA 2021.4 onwards [debug automations](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2021/04/07/release-20214/#automation-debugging).",

The current release of the Tuya firmware has an encryption that prevents the exploit, so it works on fewer and fewer products currently being sold.  If someone can figure out the password....   Or someone at the factory would leak it, this may work again.  At this point only new-old-stock items that have not been used in the Tuya App might work.  Sadly most items will not and None that have been used in the Tuya App will convert.\n\nTHEREFORE......\n\nDon't be shocked when the Tuya Convert doesn't work for you.  The man-in-the-middle attack that Tuys Convert was against Tuya Firmware has been patched by Tuya, and will likely not help you. \n\nFind a way to use the device as is, or find way to take the device apart and flash with a serial adapter.",
