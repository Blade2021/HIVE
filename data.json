  "KarmaExplanation": "***What is Karma?***\n\nAll members of DrZzs Discord server will earn 1 point every day that they participate on DrZzs Discord server.\n\nYou also have an account called Karma.  Your Karma can only be changed when someone gives you one of their points to add or subtract from your Karma account.  Karma can be positive and negative.\n\nIf someone is helpful to you and you would like to reward them, you can use ` ++ @user `, or add the reaction {kPosIcon} to the helpful statement and you will be spending one of your points to give someone else positive Karma.\n\nIf someone is clearly  bringing down the conversation or just not being nice then you can use ` -- @user `, or add a reaction to what they said with this {kNegIcon}, and you will be spending one of your points to give them negative Karma.\n\nUse your points wisely.  The ONLY thing points are good for is giving or removing Karma from others.\n\nFind out more information here: https://github.com/Blade2021/HIVE/wiki/Karma",
  "KarmaExplanationShort": "\uD83D\uDCA1 If someone has helped you, be sure to thank them by sending them positive karma via ++ @USER or using the {kPosIcon} reaction on their message, You can also send them negative karma using -- @USER or {kNegIcon} reaction on their message.  Both of these actions will cost you 1 point each.",
